Ah, summer vacation! Are you a university student, a young lad like me? Or are you a working adult with a long summer break? Hit the mark? Wake up, you're envying us students' privileges. Working in society with little vacation time, low pay, and overworking. Do you think I'm naturally enjoying life now, while you are young and can't turn back time, regretting the moments left behind?

Let's hang out together! Great talk... at the beginning of summer vacation, I feel liberated from the summer heat in Shibuya City. Seeking fun... Looking around... Couples stand out in the summer crowd. I'm an interesting, kind, and gentle person, right? Now, I'm walking alone, feeling very doubtful!

Why? My ex-girlfriend? You're being harsh. I've been a pitiful guy with a girlfriend for 1 year and 9 months. Heartbroken, shocked... You pointed it out; this summer started with loneliness. "I'm looking for a new love," like in my ideal manga by Yoshikazu Fujiwara, "Goddess-." I want a graceful, caring woman. My ideal... But I'm a hopeless guy, living a stoic life in the city. Nice guys like me have unattractive girlfriends... Nice guy, my girlfriend... No, I must be the goddess... Couples around me are tired... I fall to my knees on the hot asphalt... Oh, me, the goddess... Help me... A mysterious voice!? A mysterious voice... I'm openly speaking in the middle of the street... Sorry, options to pick. "My ex-girlfriend is here!?" "Do people over twenty hear illusions?" "Am I misunderstanding something?"

"My ex-girlfriend is here!?" I'm the one who needs help. A realistic goddess... I'm unrealistic! A mysterious voice... I'm coming! I'm waiting... My complaints... Sorry, girls. "My ex-girlfriend is here!?" I have no idea. A lovely goddess... A warm welcome, girls... Are you okay? A hallucination... Girls. A hallucination... Yes, it's a hallucination. Girls. A pervert!! Girls. Don't worry. Sorry... You think I'm hallucinating? A hallucination? Misunderstanding? Girls. Are you okay? Sorry... You're worried... My words were harsh... I'm sorry... Heart-piercing... A premonition of love. People say... God, today I met a girl on the street. Are you really okay? Nanny image girls... Lucky! Today, I'm at my best... The situation with the sun shining... I sense a summer romance. I'm looking rudely, but the air is hot... Her cheeks are red... Blushing? Who? Me? Except for me? It's tough being a popular guy.

"Flirting?" "Don't miss the chance." "Good, hurry and propose marriage." "Flirting."

My girlfriend, what's up? Girls... Tea? Girls... What's that? Common sense to invite someone. Girls... Right, don't miss the chance to call. Am I included? Girls... Included...? What? Does having a girlfriend mean something? Are you sure about that? Girls... Tea is okay... I'm troubled by the suddenness of being called a lover... Girls... Tea? I'm free... I'm okay with it... Good, hurry and propose marriage... Marriage proposal! Who? Me? Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine, fully composed! Girls... Weirdo... Weird, but still normal... Don't hesitate... Tea? Tea... Tea is okay. Tea, please... Seriously, a weirdo... So, we went to a small caf√© near the station... Just like that, our fortunes changed... So...
